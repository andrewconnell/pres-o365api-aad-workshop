On-Ramp to the Office 365 & Azure AD Highway!
=============================================
There's a lot to learn to get productive with the Office 365 APIs. In this half-day tutorial, you will learn why you should care about the Office 365 APIs and what you can do with them. But first we will discuss and explore how Azure AD works, how you can create custom applications and write code to authenticate to obtain an OAuth2 access token. Then we'll dive deep and see how we can use that access token to work with all the different Office 365 APIs the Discovery Service as well as how to use the Contacts, Calendar, Messages and Files APIs using the .NET SDK and the REST API. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have loads of code snippets and sample projects that you can use as a starting point to get going and build your own applications that leverage the Office 365 APIs!
